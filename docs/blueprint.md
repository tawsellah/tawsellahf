## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#9370DB) for trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5), nearly white, for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for key actions to maintain a consistent, focused experience, and accessibility.
- Use the 'Cairo' font throughout the application for a clean and modern Arabic text rendering, ensuring readability and a consistent visual identity.
- Employ Font Awesome icons for visual cues. In particular, consider a new seat icon.
- Implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Ensure consistent spacing and alignment in the right-to-left layout, which is the arabic direction.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations, such as scaling seats upon selection.
